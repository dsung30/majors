# Majors Score Tracker
This will track individual and team scores using webscraping. See below for an example output. Inputs to the file should be the url, draft results, and cutline. It is recommended to set the cutline to a high number prior to the cut (e.g., 1000). The cutline is used as a maximum score for players who make the cut.
